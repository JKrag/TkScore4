# TkScore4 Roadmap

## What this is

A complete rewrite of TkScore3 (Perl, 2012) as a client-side web app. TICA cat show
organizers use it to score shows and generate the official `.txt` reports they file with
TICA. The new app must produce byte-identical reports to the original.

**Tech stack:** Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite. No server. Runs in any modern browser.

## Current state (as of 2026-05-25)

### Done

- [x] Root `CLAUDE.md` — project context, read-only reference structure, non-negotiables
- [x] `TkScore4/` initialized: Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vitest (28 TS tests pass)
- [x] `tools/tks_to_json.py` — converts legacy `.tks` (Perl Data::Dumper) to JSON
  - Handles: `undef`→null, bare integer keys, integer vs string cat IDs (`401` ≠ `"401A"`),
    escaped quotes, CP1252/Latin-1 encoding fallback
  - 28 pytest tests covering all edge cases + all 9 real 2013 golden files
- [x] `TkScore4/CLAUDE.md` — data model reference, test workflow, architecture notes

### Done (continued)

- [x] Golden file integration test harness (`src/__tests__/report.golden.test.ts`)
  - 12 tests: 120526e (4), 120526g (3), 120602a (4), all 12 passing
  - Test helper normalizes tie-group ordering before comparison (Perl hash order is non-reproducible)
- [x] Report generator (`src/scoring/report.ts`, `src/scoring/types.ts`)
  - Bugs fixed: trailing newline, `printscore` Perl falsiness (`'0'`), roster indent (uses `catalog.options.namewidth`), entry sort order (insertion-order tiebreaker), roster caption rows (ring names with " - " get extra caption line), dynamic `breedwidth` defaulting to Perl's 3 (overridable via `ReportOptions.breedwidth`), `BreedWidth` treated as session option not stored in `.tks`

### Not started
- [ ] Expand golden file tests to remaining 6 `.tks` show files (120609a/d, 120623a/b/d/e — need golden `.txt` pairs generated first)
- [ ] `mixedcase` option — title-case transformation for club name, date, cat names when `options.mixedcase=1` (currently passes because 2013 corpus data is already in mixed case)
- [ ] Vue UI (data entry, show management)
- [ ] In-app .tks import (optional — converter tool is sufficient for testing)

## Reference material (read-only, do not modify)

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `../TkScore_Win/lib/TkScore/` | Authoritative Perl source. Read this before implementing any feature. |
| `../TkScore_Win/2013/*.tks` | 9 real show records (2012–2013) |
| `../TkScore_Win/2013/*.txt` | Expected report output for each show |

**Key Perl modules by feature:**
- Score calculation: `Finals.pm`, `Entries.pm`
- Report layout: `ShowReport.pm`, `FinalsReport.pm`, `EntriesReport.pm`
- File I/O: `Catalog.pm` (reads/writes .tks via Data::Dumper)
- Breed lookups: `BreedCodeTable.pm`, `Breeds.pm`

**Golden file naming:** `120526e_36_3.txt` = show `120526e`, `namewidth=36`, `colwidth=3`.
Each `.tks` has up to 4 corresponding `.txt` files (different format options).

---

## Next steps (in order)

### Step 1 — Golden file integration test harness

**Goal:** One failing Vitest test that defines the pipeline we need to build.

1. Convert golden `.tks` files to JSON fixtures:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p test-fixtures
   python3 tools/tks_to_json.py --batch ../TkScore_Win/2013/ test-fixtures/
   ```
2. Write `src/__tests__/report.golden.test.ts`:
   - Load `test-fixtures/120526e.json`
   - Call `generateReport(data, { namewidth: 36, colwidth: 3 })`
   - Compare output to `../TkScore_Win/2013/120526e_36_3.txt`
3. Start with one show, one format option. The test should fail cleanly (function not yet
   implemented), establishing the contract.

### Step 2 — Report generator (`src/scoring/report.ts`)

**Goal:** Make the golden file test pass for `120526e_36_3.txt`.

Reference: `../TkScore_Win/lib/TkScore/ShowReport.pm`, `FinalsReport.pm`,
`EntriesReport.pm`.

The `.txt` format is fixed-width text. Key sections (from the golden file):
1. Header — club, location, date
2. Show grid — judges × days, with AB/SP designation
3. KITTENS section — one row per cat, columns per ring
4. CATS section — same structure
5. ALTERS section
6. HOUSEHOLD PETS section
7. Ring count footers
8. (Specialty rings have LH/SH sub-sections)

Work section by section, driven by the golden file test. Each section should have
its own unit tests in `src/__tests__/`.

### Step 3 — Scoring/calculation engine (`src/scoring/finals.ts`, `entries.ts`)

**Goal:** Correct point calculations feeding the report.

Reference: `../TkScore_Win/lib/TkScore/Finals.pm`, `Entries.pm`.

Key rules to implement:
- Allbreed vs Specialty ring scoring differences
- LH/SH split for specialty rings
- Point accumulation across rings
- Congress ring handling (`congress` flag on ring objects)

Each calculation rule gets a unit test before implementation.

### Step 4 — Vue UI

**Goal:** Usable data entry and show management interface.

Only start this after Step 2–3 are verified against golden files. The UI is secondary
to correctness.

Planned views:
- Show setup (club, date, judges, ring config)
- Entry input (cat number, name, breed)
- Finals entry (per-ring placement input)
- Report preview and download

## Engineering rules

1. **Read the Perl source first.** Before implementing any scoring rule or report section,
   find and read the corresponding `.pm` file. The source is the spec.

2. **Golden file before feature complete.** No scoring or report feature is done until
   it passes at least one golden file pair end-to-end.

3. **Test with the code.** New parsing rules, calculations, and report sections get tests
   immediately — not as an afterthought.

4. **Regression tests for bugs.** When a bug is fixed, add a test for the specific case
   that was broken.

5. **Scoring logic stays out of components.** Keep `src/scoring/` as pure TypeScript
   with no Vue dependencies. Testable without DOM.
